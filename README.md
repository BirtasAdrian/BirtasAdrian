- 👋 Hi, I’m Birtas Adrian
- 👀 I’m interested in Quality Assurance Software Testing
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on QA Software Testing opportunities.
- Currently I'm learning QA Manual Testing from Ctrl+n by Bittnet Training. Link course: https://www.ctrln.ro/cursuri/software/software-tester-qa-manual-curs-it/


I'm an ambitious person who loves to evolve by learning new things with patience and optimism. I always love to search for new things in order to develop a better version of me.
I’m familiar with tools like Jira, Taiga, TestLink, TestRail, Postman, WebdriverIO, Cypress, phpMyAdmin and MySQL Workbench. 
Also, I attend Manual Testing and Automation Testing webinars organized by the company IT Factory where I ask questions in order to understand new things and aspects that I learned from the Udemy platform. 
My Github portofolio is constantly improved by the new and diverse aspects that keep my mind updated and wired.
