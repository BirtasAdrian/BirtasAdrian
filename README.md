- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Birtas Adrian
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Quality Assurance Software Testing, programming, and Databases. 
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on QA Software Testing or similar opportunities.
- Currently, I am enhancing my skills in Java Object Oriented Programming through the Academia Programatorilor course. You can find the course link here: https://www.academiaprogramatorilor.ro/courses/modul-java-oop
- Also I'm currently enrolled in the ITFactory platform focused on Manual and Automated Testing.


As a passionate and ambitious individual, I am constantly seeking ways to improve myself and acquire new knowledge with patience and optimism. I am proficient in using various tools such as Jira, Taiga, TestLink, TestRail, Postman, WebdriverIO, Cypress, phpMyAdmin, and MySQL Workbench.

I also attend webinars on Manual and Automation Testing, where I ask questions to gain a better understanding of new concepts and ideas. My GitHub portfolio reflects my continued efforts to stay updated with the latest developments in the field.
