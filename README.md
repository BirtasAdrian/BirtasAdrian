- 👋 Hi, I’m Birtas Adrian
- 👀 I’m interested in Quality Assurance Software Testing
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on QA Software Testing opportunities.
- Currently, I am enhancing my skills in Manual Testing through the Ctrl+n course by Bittnet Training. You can find the course link here: https://www.ctrln.ro/cursuri/software/software-tester-qa-manual-curs-it/


As a passionate and ambitious individual, I am constantly seeking ways to improve myself and acquire new knowledge with patience and optimism. I am proficient in using various tools such as Jira, Taiga, TestLink, TestRail, Postman, WebdriverIO, Cypress, phpMyAdmin, and MySQL Workbench.

I also attend webinars on Manual and Automation Testing, where I ask questions to gain a better understanding of new concepts and ideas. My GitHub portfolio reflects my continued efforts to stay updated with the latest developments in the field.

Recent Projects:

In my most recent project, which I completed while studying at SkillBrain It School, I created checklists, test cases, bug reports and suggested improvements for two sections of the OrangeHRM website.
