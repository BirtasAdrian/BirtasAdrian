- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Birtas Adrian
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Quality Assurance Software Testing, Programming, and Databases. 
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on QA Software Testing or similar opportunities.
- Currently, I am enhancing my skills in Automation Testing with Selenium and the Java programming language
- I work as a volunteer tester at Code for Romania but also on 2 projects for a client (web and mobile testing) where I test modules like: Payments, reservation, AI for prices and marketing, statistics, customer and staff management, web to mobile data integration (Sometimes I write documentation for modules too, updating it and correcting it with the developers and the client starting with Static Testing) 


As a passionate and ambitious individual, I am constantly seeking ways to improve myself and acquire new knowledge with patience and optimism. I am proficient in using various tools such as Jira, Taiga, TestLink, TestRail, Postman, Selenium, Cypress, phpMyAdmin, and MySQL Workbench.

I also attend webinars on Manual and Automation Testing, where I ask questions to gain a better understanding of new concepts and ideas. My GitHub portfolio reflects my continued efforts to stay updated with the latest developments in the field.
